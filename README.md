This Genesys Blueprint provides instructions for deploying a messaging assistant on Genesys Cloud. The Messaging Assistant actively listens to the messaging interaction and suggest responses based on keywords. Sending messages and the typing indicator features of the Messaging API will be convenient in this scenario.

Genesys Cloud uses the Interaction Widget to provide agents with a list of suggested response.
